    <div class="verse indent0">If you read on ’till the story is done,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">You will have many happy hours</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With Mother Bunny and her Flowers.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>One bright spring morning Old
Mother Bun was talking to herself.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Said Old Mother Bun, just for fun,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“It is time the garden was begun.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Old Father Bun cried,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Time for the rake, and time for the hoe;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We’ll plant a garden in spring you know.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span></p>
<p>Healthy Bunny and Pretty Bunny
said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Garden days have come, we know;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">May we help the seeds to grow?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Old Mother Bun answered,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“To the garden all may go,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With the rake, and with the hoe.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>So those cute little Bunnies ran out with
rake, and hoe, and wheelbarrow, and
they all worked in Mother Bun’s garden,
helping her prepare the soil for her garden.
She was very happy and shook the
packages of seeds in her gingham apron,
saying,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Vegetables and flowers too,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I will try to raise for you.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Not for me, not for me,” called a voice,
and a very wild looking Bunny peeped
over the fence.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">He said, “At times I’m very plucky.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My name is really ‘Happy-Go-Lucky’.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="image005" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image005.jpg" alt="rabbit digging" />
</div>


<p>He offered to help, for every one loved
Old Mother Bun, but he was such a careless
fellow, he did not dig the rows
straight, and Old Father Bun soon made
him stop, so he sat on a fence.</p>

<p>When the ground was ready, Old
Father Bun drove in stakes at the end of
the rows, and he tied a cord from one
stake to another so they could plant in
even rows.</p>

<p>Old Mother Bun used the hoe and the
little Bunnies ran after her and dropped
in seeds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Oh, I forgot, and so, please stop,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Before another seed you drop.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“What did you forget, Mother Bunny?”
asked Healthy Bunny.</p>

<p>“Can we help you to remember?” added
Pretty Bunny.</p>

<p>“We are waiting,” said Old Father Bunny.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Mother Bunny said, “Before we start,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Find out, in planting, how far apart.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>She read the directions on each envelope
to find out how far apart the seeds
were to be planted, and how deep they
were to be placed. This was important,
for some seeds grow better planted deep,
and some grow better planted near the
surface with a very little dirt scattered
over them.</p>

<p>That day she planted lettuce and
radishes and Old Father Bun said,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Such a very little our seeds have cost,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We will not worry about Jack Frost.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Old Mother Bun said that early vegetables
could stand a little frost and if
we plant North-Grown seeds, the vegetables
can even stand a little snow.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">She continued, “If you please,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I will plant vegetable peas.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It was late in March and the air was
cool, though the sun shone warm and
bright.</p>

<p>She said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I’ve planned my garden with much care,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But forgot to make paths, I declare.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Old Father Bun said they would help
her plan out the paths, and that Healthy
Bunny and Pretty Bunny might use the
wheelbarrow and bring over some bricks
to lay in the paths.</p>

<p>Soon the garden began to look very
well indeed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Said Father Bun, “Let’s have a talk,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">How to plan out garden walks.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Old Mother Bun grew thoughtful and
said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Let us make the walks so wide,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We can travel side by side.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>They had plenty of room, so they made
their brick walks, or paths as they
called them, four feet wide.</p>

<p>Old Father Bun said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Now they look very well indeed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But what will we do with grass and weeds?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>All the Bunnies sat down and put on
their Thinking-Caps, for they had an old
brick walk in the back yard, and grass
and weeds crept up between the bricks
every year.</p>

<p>The Happy-Go-Lucky Bunny said at
last,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I learned this from the Peddler’s daughter,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sow salt, and cover it with water.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

  <div class="caption">The Cute Little Bunnies Ran Out with Rake
and Hoe and Wheelbarrow</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span></p>

<p>Old Father Bun remembered this was
a good idea, but he said no salt must
get into the garden soil.</p>

<p>Old Mother Bun said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I have plans now in my head</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To make a pretty Flower Bed.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>They divided off the part of the
garden that was left, and planned out
many pretty Flower Beds.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Old Mother Bun worked hours and hours,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Making a circular bed for flowers.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">She was happy, I’ve heard said,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When she looked at her star-shaped bed.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>She said, “Oh, see the star-shaped
bed! Oh, see the garden we planted
last year!” All of them bent down, and
it was Old Mother Bun who discovered
the first Crocus.</p>

<p>Sure enough, there was a purple
Crocus in bloom. She said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I am so happy I’ll sing and sing;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Here is a flower to greet the spring.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Old Father Bun did a lot of thinking
and said presently,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="image010" style="max-width: 62.5em;">

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Ha, ha, I’ve an idea funny;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We’ll make a garden with letters BUNNY.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He marked off the letters on the
ground and said they would plant there
next day.</p>

<p>Old Mother Bun picked the Crocus
and took it in-doors and set it in a
vase. When they had washed their
paws they sat around and admired it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span></p>

<p>Old Mother Bun began to knit for
she was never idle.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Said Mother Bunny, “Do you know</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">How to plant flowers and make them grow?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>She looked hard at Happy-Go-Lucky,
who did not answer her.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Said Pretty Bunny, ”As like as not,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I’ll have to buy a flower-pot.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Pretty Bunny liked to have a blooming
plant in the window.</p>

<p>Old Father Bun said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Flowers breathe air, I do declare,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With honest toil, they eat from the soil;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Though they stand still and cannot walk,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In Fairyland I heard them talk.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The little Crocus in the vase began
to nod, and nod, and open its petals,
and, to the surprise of all, began to talk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The Crocus said, “Please do not doubt me;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There are many legends told about me.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then the Crocus began to tell the
story or legend she liked the best. She
said, “I am the little child, Krokus, who
was killed by an accident when Mercury
threw a quoit one day, and I was changed
at once into a flower.” (Crocus continued)</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Here is a story to make you laugh;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I was hidden once in a hollow staff.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A Pilgrim stole a bulb, you see,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And took it to a far country;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So many flowers from it came,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Saffron Waldon is the town’s real name.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Saffron, Saffron, what do I know
about Saffron?” asked Old Father Bun.</p>

<p>Old Mother Bun said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“As sure as I am wide awake,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I use Saffron in cookies and cake.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Crocus said, “Saffron is made
from my stamens; several thousand of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
them are needed for one ounce of
Saffron.”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Some Crocuses are not like me at all;</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">I’ll close up my petals in an hour,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But a hair-dye was once made from my flower.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>So saying, the Crocus closed her petals
and fell asleep.</p>

<p>Pretty Bunny said, “I wonder if every
flower has a story to tell.”</p>

<p>Healthy Bunny said, “Old Mother
Bun, what kind of flowers will you have
in your garden this year?”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

    <div class="verse indent0">Always live on year after year.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>She reminded her children that Annuals,
as they are called, grow from
seeds and bloom only one season, while<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>

the next year, and then die.</p>

<p>Healthy Bunny said, naming some

<p>The Bunnies drew close while she drew
a picture of a Morning Glory and said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The parts of a flower, I do believe,</div>

  </div>
</div>

<p>She drew the little fine roots of the
Morning Glory and the long, winding
stem and dainty leaves and flower.</p>

<p>The Family Clock struck nine, and
Old Father Bun said,</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">“I interrupt you, I beg pardon;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When may we visit your wild-flower garden?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Old Mother Bun had been planting
a wild-flower garden for years and
years. The Bunnies had often gone to
the woods and dug up a single plant of
its kind for they did not want to rob
even the woods of beauty, and so they
had many wild flowers growing in their
home garden, and they had also a lovely
bed of ferns.</p>

<p>Old Mother Bun said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“We’ll visit the wild-flower garden and see,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who our first visitor will be.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Happy-Go-Lucky Bunny jumped out
the open window and ran out in the moonlight.</p>

<p>Pretty Bunny and Healthy Bunny
went to bed.</p>

<p>Old Mother Bun tried to remember
the names of some of her Flowers. She
made what she called an “Acrostic”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
which spelled the names of Flowers read
to the right, and spelled the name of a
Flower downward. She wrote the following:</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">Crocus</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Your visitor is on his way.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Old Mother Bun went to bed wondering
who her visitor would be in the
Garden to-morrow. She made up her
mind to rise at sunrise and see if any
of her visitors had come.</p>

<p>She said,</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Bright and early Old Mother Bun
went out to look at her Wild Flower
Garden. She said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Trillium and Anemone,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Your little flowers I long to see;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Wild Ginger and Columbine,</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>As Old Mother Bun tip-toed about her
Wild Flower Garden the flowers nodded
their welcome and began to talk to her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The Trillium said, “If you please,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">All my parts are in three’s.</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Old Mother Bun said, “I am glad you
grow in my Garden, and I like the Solitary
Flowers just as well as though they
grew in clusters like those of Lily-of-the-Valley.”</p>

<p>Just then Old Father Bun looked out
the window and called,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Old Mother Bun, I beg your pardon;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who was the first visitor in the Garden?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Pretty Bunny just then called out,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I’m coming out just for fun,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Old Mother Bun, Old Mother Bun.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Healthy Bunny cried,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span></p>
<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="image022" style="max-width: 62.5em;">

</div>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“There is something makes me want to sing,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Every year, in the early spring.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Just as Old Mother Bun began to
think a member of her own family would
be her first visitor she heard a whir of
wings, and a humming sound, and a
Humming Bird lighted on a Tulip.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span></p>

<p>The Humming Bird sang to her,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I am happy as can be</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Honeysuckle soon I’ll see.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Old Mother Bun said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Many years that whir I’ve heard.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Welcome, little Humming Bird.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Humming Bird went from flower
to flower, finding honey and nectar in
them. He said he came to visit the
garden unusually early, as he was really
a summer visitor.</p>

<p>The Anemones were the next flowers
that wanted to speak. They said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“We like to grow here in your bower.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Anemone, also called Windflower.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Old Mother Bun had to search for the
flower on the Wild Ginger plant. There
was a single flower well hidden beneath
the velvety leaves. She gave a cry of
pleasure, for looking up she saw a
Yellow Lady’s Slipper in bloom. The
Lady’s Slipper nodded in a friendly way
and said,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Our flowers are really a delight;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We are pink, showy, or small white.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>She said there were three species of
Lady’s Slippers. She sang sweetly,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“In colonies we like to grow,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When the merry spring winds blow;</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">I carry from one to three pretty flowers.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Healthy Bunny and Pretty Bunny and
Old Father Bun came out and leaned
down low to catch the faintest whisper
from the flowers. The Solomon’s Seal
whispered,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Many secrets I could reveal,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But my name is Solomon’s Seal.</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Patiently growing hour by hour;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I am a Perennial, my dear,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But throw us a fresh stalk every year;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As my flowers with a scar they make;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">You can tell my age by them without mistake,</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">In the woods we grow so tall, ’tis said</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We tower sometimes above man’s head.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Now, the False Solomon’s Seal, ’tis true,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">May appear more beautiful to you.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Just then Jack-In-The-Pulpit fairly
shouted,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I am Jack-In-The-Pulpit come to town;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I am dressed much like a Circus Clown.</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">I am very glad to meet you all,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And I’ll leave red berries in the fall.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>A voice called merrily,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“To squeeze my stem you’d better refrain,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For everything I touch, I stain;</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">I am white with gold centre; does it pay</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To bloom, as I do, for a single day?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>All the Bunnies examined the Blood
root with the leaf circling round the
stem, and the delicate flowers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span></p>

<p>Old Father Bun remarked,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Right down here, in this Fairy Bower,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Let us learn the parts of a flower.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Just then a beautiful Butterfly sailed
by, and attracted by the color in the Tulip
Bed, sailed down, so, as a Butterfly and
Humming Bird came to the garden that
day, Old Mother Bun said, “What fine
visitors.”</p>

<p>Old Father Bun said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I will try to teach you, if in my power,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To know and name the parts of a flower;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Calyx, corolla, pistils, and stamens,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Over and over let us name them.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Old Mother Bun said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The Calyx is really the flower-cup;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">See the gay Tulips springing up.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Old Father Bun said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“To describe is really beyond my power,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The Corolla is the prettiest part of the flower.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span></p>
<p>Father Bun continued,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The Stamens inside the Corolla grow,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the pistils hold the seeds, you know.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Just then a shout arose and a voice
called,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I turn up at odd times, it is funny,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I am Happy-Go-Lucky Bunny.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>They were all glad to see him, of
course, and began to play a Flower Game.
He stood in the centre of a circle they
formed and said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Ha, ha, I’m very glad I came,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I’m thinking of a Wild Flower’s name:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Clap him out, clap him in,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With letter ‘V’ the name begins.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He pointed to Healthy Bunny who
cried, “Violet,” and changed places with
him, calling for a flower whose name began
with another letter, as “D” for “Dandelion”
or “Daisy.” The game went on
merrily. Every time after a flower was
named the Bunnies skipped round the
circle singing, to the tune of “Twinkle
Little Star,”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Flower Games we love to play,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In the spring when we are gay;</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">You can come and join our games.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>They had such a merry time that they
almost forgot to go in to dinner.</p>

<p>As they finally sat down to dinner a
Fairy Voice called,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I am Skunk Cabbage; for me make room,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I am the earliest Wild Flower to bloom.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I am useful to you, you see;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My root is used as a remedy.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Though the Bunnies liked Vegetable
Cabbage they would not let the Skunk
Cabbage in.</p>

<p>After dinner was over, Old Father
Bun said, “I like to tell stories.”</p>

<p>Old Mother Bun, who was something
of a tease, said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Why don’t you make that into a verse?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It may sound better, or may sound worse.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span></p>
<p>Old Father Bun thought a few minutes
and then said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I like to tell stories about Flowers;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I could tell them for hours and hours.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Old Mother Bun had picked a Snowdrop
and it nodded to them and whispered,
before Old Father Bun could say
another word.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="image029" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image029.jpg" alt="Snowdrops" />
</div>

<p>The Snowdrop said a story was told
about her being made from a snowflake
as an angel breathed upon her,
and this comforted Eve, with the mes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>sage
of Spring, and so the Snowdrop became
a flower of comfort and promise.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="image030" style="max-width: 62.5em;">

</div>


<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span></p>

<p>As the Bunnies grew thoughtful they
noticed a few flakes of snow falling,
and they saw that they took the form
of beautiful snow crystals.</p>

<p>“Oh, oh,” cried Old Mother Bun. “See
the snow falling.”</p>

<p>Old Father Bun said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The snow will not hurt your flowers, I know;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The snow will soon melt and make them grow.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Sure enough, the light fall of snow
did not hurt the flowers at all, and soon
the sun shone and Shadow Bunny called,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Come out and play, come out and play;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Come and enjoy this fine spring day.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>When evening came the Bunnies were
so tired they went happily off to bed.
Old Mother Bun told them a story about
her Tulip Bed. She said she once heard
a Folk-Tale about Old Mother Delight
who went out one night with a lighted
lantern in her garden, and discovered
that the Fairies had hidden their babies
in her Tulips for the night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span></p>

<p>Mother Delight planted more Tulip
Bulbs and the Fairies were so happy
they brought her Good Luck.</p>

<p>Mother Delight looked at one of her
Tulips and said, “You look so like a
turban, I believe you were named from
your resemblance to it, and you are so
beautiful no wonder they hold a Tulip
Festival in Turkey every year.”</p>

<p>Old Mother Bun’s voice grew lower
and lower and sank to a whisper as the
little Bunnies fell asleep.</p>

<p>They did not know at that very minute
FIVE LITTLE FAIRIES WERE
CURLED UP IN THE TULIPS IN
THEIR OWN GARDEN.</p>

<p>These Fairies were named the Ticklish
Elf, the Useful Elf, the Laughing
Elf, the Impish Elf, the Pretty Elf.</p>

<p>The first letters of their names spelled
downward made the name “TULIP.”</p>

<p>If you read on you will learn what
the little Elves did in Mother Bun’s
Garden.</p>

</div>

<p>The Ticklish Elf tumbled out of the
Tulip Bed head first, and climbed up
the water spout, and into the window
where Healthy Bunny and Pretty
Bunny were lying in their little beds.</p>

</div>

<p>The Useful Elf helped them dress.</p>

<p>The Laughing Elf set them laughing.</p>

<p>The Impish Elf hid their hair ribbons,
and shoes, and played many tricks upon
them.</p>

<p>The Pretty Elf just sat on the mantle
piece and looked as pretty as pretty
could be.</p>

<p>The Bunnies had a merry time and
Old Mother Bun was happy when she
saw her red Tulips, red and yellow, for
the Elves had used their paint brushes
to make the Tulips gay.</p>

<p>Old Mother Bun said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Here is also a pretty sight,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My dwarf dandelions close at night.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Her wild flower garden was bordered
with little dwarf dandelions.</p>

<p>The Bunnies all went into the garden
and the Elves disappeared.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span></p>

<p>Old Mother Bun said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

    <div class="verse indent0">“In a garden we must not shirk;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There is always plenty of work.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>So they began to pull weeds and
talked about watering thirsty flowers.</p>

<p>Old Father Bun came out with a
basket and said he was going to the
woods to get Mullen leaves. He said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I will use the leaves for lamp-wicks, you know,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As the Greeks did once so long ago.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Old Mother Bun said, “Be sure to
gather plenty of Mullen leaves, for I will
soak them in oil and if any one gets a
pain that will help them.” So Old Father
Bun went off singing,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent0">“Mullen leaves, Mullen leaves</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Sunflowers had been sowing their
own seeds in Old Mother Bun’s garden.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
She was so glad to see them and knew
they would attract birds who liked to
eat the seeds.</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/image036.jpg" alt="Bunny in garden" />
</div>

<p>She knew, too, that oil from them could
be used to burn. She continued, that
paper is made from stalk, head, and
stem of the sunflower.</p>

<p>The Humming Bird came and sang,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“There is one thing I forgot to mention,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">For this wonderful Sky-Blue Flower.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Sure enough, the Humming Bird
greatly loved flowers of a certain color,
and the Fringed Gentian was nearer the
color of the sky than any Flower that
grew. Best of all, the Gentian was really
growing in one corner of Old Mother
Bun’s garden, and the Humming Bird
hummed with delight.</p>

<p>The little Bunnies said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent0">“Perhaps each Elf wears an invisible cloak,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For time and again we thought they spoke.”</div>

<p>They liked to imagine that the Elves
from the Tulip Bed were about the
garden in the day time, to help them.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent0">Said Old Mother Bun, “Come and see</div>

<p>The old Lilac bush was full of buds
and Pretty Bunny picked a branch and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
took it into the house, and set it in a
jar of water.</p>
<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="image038" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image038.jpg" alt="Misc. flowers" />

<p>Old Mother Bunny taught the Bunnies
the names of all the Wild Flowers
in her garden. There were the Violets
and Anemones, the Blood-Root, and
Dandelions, the Wild-Ginger and fringed
Gentian, the Jack-In-The-Pulpit and
Trillium, the Flax, and Mustard, and
Lady’s Slipper and many others.</p>

<p>Healthy Bunny whispered to Pretty
Bunny,</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>They slipped away to look for this wild
flower that grows by the roadside, but
they were too early to find it in bloom.</p>

<p>They met Happy-Go-Lucky Bunny,
and Shadow Bunny, and Homeless
Bunny, and they all traveled together
and sang,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“It is merry springtime if you please;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Buds are swelling on the trees.</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Apple blossoms will appear in an hour.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It was almost Apple Blossom time.</p>

<p>Shadow Bunny followed them around
everywhere and said by and by,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I am learning to talk in verse;</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">For this is a Flower that sows itself.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He explained that the farmer disliked
this flower for sowing itself, and spreading
over fertile soil they wanted for planting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span></p>

</div>

<p>Just then, Old Father Bun returned
with his pocket full of mullen leaves and
he said he brought home a bouquet of
dandelions. He had buttercups, too, in
his basket. He said that he found buttercups
all over the meadows and they
were not liked by cows or horses because
of the bitter juice they contained. He
said as nothing troubled the buttercups,
they bloomed freely everywhere. He
had gathered marsh buttercups, creeping
buttercups and bristly buttercups.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span></p>

<p>He said he found some common flax
growing a foot and a half high. The
blue flowers were pretty and he said it
was a most useful plant, linen being
made from its fibres, and oil from its
seed.</p>

<p>He said while resting in the meadow
the Flax told him this story: “The Earth
Goddess Hilda comes to visit us. She
comes to the earth to see how much
Flax is planted, and returns by winter
to see if there is enough Flax for spring
and if the spinning wheels are all busy.
She rewards the busy people and punishes
the lazy ones.”</p>

<p>After supper the Bunnies gathered
round the bunch of Dandelions Old
Father Bun had gathered, and one Dandelion,
larger than the rest, began to
talk. It said, “Once upon a time the
South Wind loved me, for I was then a
young girl with yellow hair, and for a
while I grew more and more beautiful;
but by and by I grew old and faded,
for I was touched by a breath of the
North Wind. The South Wind sighed,
and soon I was gone, but the next year<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
the ground was covered with flowers like
me. I am now said to resemble the sun,
and, like other flowers, turn toward it.”</p>

<p>The Bunnies drew and colored a picture
of the dandelion and wrote the
story in a little book to keep.</p>

</div>

<p>The Evening Primrose was opening.
It was uncurling its petals for the visit of
the night moth.</p>

<p>Pretty Bunny said, “I wonder if it
will be the cradle for a wee little Elf,
as the Tulip is.”</p>

<p>Healthy Bunny said, “I know a funny
thing about it. Its root was used to eat,

</div>

<p>There was music in the garden for the
Harebells were ringing; they sang of
the “Bluebells of Scotland.”</p>

<p>Old Father Bun said,</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">“We will be busy indeed, I know,</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span></p>
<p>Healthy Bunny and Pretty Bunny
went off to bed singing,</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>Happy-Go-Lucky Bunny and Homeless
Bunny had gone away, but they
begged to be allowed to come and plant
next day.</p>

<p>Just as the little Bunnies were falling
asleep there arose a voice, and they knew
that spring had surely come, for the dear
Little Tree Toad, who ate harmful insects,
called,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Ticklish Elf peeped in the window
early next morning and tickled the
Bunnies with a bit of grass, calling,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Let us go to the garden of Old Mother Bun;</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">There will be fun there for every one.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Healthy Bunny and Pretty Bunny got
up quickly and dressed and the Ticklish
Elf said, as the Bunnies complained that
the grass tickled their toes,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The grass is my friend, for, goodness knows,</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Are there Fairy Families and Flower
Families?” asked the Bunnies in surprise.</p>

<p>The Ticklish Elf did not answer the
first part of the question but went off
singing,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The Mint Family and Holly Family,</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Every one was hurrying next day to
finish the seed planting. There were
Morning Glory seeds and Nasturtium
seeds to plant by the porch. There were
Pansy seeds to plant in the little round
bed by the front door. There were seeds
of Bachelor’s Buttons and Mignonette.</p>

<p>Suddenly Old Father Bun came with a
flag from the house and shouted,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Here is an idea, perhaps it’s new,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Let’s plant a flower bed, red, white and blue.”</div>

</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span></p>
<p>“A red, white and blue garden,” said
Healthy Bunny.</p>

<p>“A red, white and blue flower bed,”
said Pretty Bunny.</p>

<p>“Red, white and blue, red, white and
blue,” sang the Bunnies together. Echo
Bunny called, “Red, white and blue.”</p>

<p>Old Mother Bun helped plan the red,
white, and blue flower bed. She said,
“We can have Salvia for the red flowers,
and Daisies for the white. For the
blue flowers we can have Forget-Me-Nots,
or Phlox, Blue Bells or Gentians.”
She said, “Where did you get the idea?”</p>

<p>Old Father Bun said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I took one cabbage, I hope he’ll pardon,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Of planting his flowers red, white, and blue.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Bunnies went to work in real
earnest on the red, white, and blue
flower bed.</p>

<p>When they grew tired working, they
played this flower game.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span></p>

<p>Old Father Bunny stood in the centre
of a circle.</p>

<p>Father Bunny pointed to any Bunny
in the circle saying,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“How do you do? how do you do?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I think of a flower whose color is blue.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He called on any Bunny who had to
name a blue flower or go out of the
game. A different color was called for
each time and they sang a little song
to the tune of “Lightly Row,”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Pink or blue, pink or blue,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">I can name, can you?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Shadow Bunny, and Homeless Bunny,
and Happy-Go-Luck Bunny helped them
play the game. Pretty Bunny and
Healthy Bunny could not always name a
flower quickly.</p>

<p>Those five little Bunnies stood in a row
and watched Old Mother Bun plant her
garden, then as a little shower came up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
all came inside but Shadow Bunny who
called,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I hope you will have lots of fun;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I always vanish with the sun.”</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">“Best of all I like the fruits,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But to-day let’s study roots.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He said the root is the simplest part
of the plant and he said a plant has a
primary root which it sends down into
the soil, and some plants also have secondary
roots which spring from the
stem.</p>

<p>Some time before Old Mother Bun had
planted a sweet pea. She had stretched
a piece of netting over a glass with
water in it, and had placed the pea on
top of the netting.</p>

<p>The Bunnies saw the roots growing
downward.</p>

<p>They remembered that they had

    <div class="verse indent0">May I come in and talk myself?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Healthy Bunny went to let the Useful
Elf into the house.</p>

<p>The Wee Elf shook the water off his
tiny leaf umbrella and called merrily,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Ha, ha, please let me explain,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Flowers grow in sun and in the rain.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He said he had been waiting under a
toad-stool to keep dry. He had noticed
the open window and so thought he
would come in a while. He continued,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I shake water off my rubber boots,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Much to the delight of the fibrous roots.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span></p>
<p>Pretty Bunny inquired, “Do roots
have names?”</p>

<p>Healthy Bunny said, “Do fibrous roots
like water?”</p>

<p>The Useful Elf nodded and remarked,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Fibrous roots, so I’ve heard said,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Look much like slender threads;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Fleshy roots drink water up,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Try to think, don’t talk like a parrot,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">See the tap-root of the carrot.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He produced a tiny basket filled with
carrots and they had a feast. When
his basket was quite empty he said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“There are three kinds of tap-roots I know&mdash;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Beet, radish, and turnips&mdash;in that way grow.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>To the surprise of all, the basket was
soon filled with vegetables again and the
Beets called in loud voices,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“We’re stout and gradually taper down;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We’re the conical roots, just come to town.”</div>

</div>

<p>The Radishes blushed and said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“We are spindle-shaped, we might as well tell;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We taper downward, and up as well.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Turnips were not to be out-done
by the rest so they cried,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“To the tap-roots we belong;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We are turnip-shaped, wider and long.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Those funny little vegetables began to
dance, and the Useful Elf began to
dance, and soon the Bunnies were all
dancing as though by magic.</p>

<p>When they had danced themselves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
quite out of breath they sat down in a
circle and begged the Elf to tell them
a Fairy Tale.</p>

<p>He said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“To get me started, I beg pardon,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But mention something in your garden.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He looked hard at Old Mother Bun,
for her garden was famous to all Elves
and Fairies.</p>

<p>She said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“We have many visitors, let me see,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I will mention the Bumble-Bee.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Elf said the same little verse looking
hard at Old Father Bun,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“To get me started, I beg pardon,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But mention something in your garden.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Old Father Bun mentioned a Butterfly
and a Toad, a Robin and an Oriole, a
Moth and Dragon Fly, but the Elf
screwed up his wee face into many
wrinkles, and it was only when Pretty
Bunny cried out that he got started,
and you see for yourself now what she
mentioned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Oh, little Elf, wait just a minute;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I saw a web with a spider in it.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Elf capered about and cried out,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I have to wind the machinery in my head</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">By that word ‘Spider’ that you said.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He began to tell the Fairy Tale of
Cotton, saying,&mdash;Once upon a time there
was a Fairy forever spinning,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">If you called for breakfast, supper, dinner,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">You never saw so great a spinner.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>She was continually spinning from
morning ’till night,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Her Uncle had willed her, too, you see,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For a spindle, the sting of a Bumble Bee.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>There was another spinner who lived
near the Fairy. He was an enormous
spider with stripes upon his back. He
did not like to think the Fairy was a
more wonderful spinner than he, so he
decided to kill her. She was frightened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
and began to run, carefully hiding her
spindle, and the spider ran after her.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">She came to the house of a wee gray Mouse</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And said, “May I rest in your little house?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Mouse was busy eating cheese
and would not open the door of his
house.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">To the Tree-Toad she told her plight,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He said, “Call on me some other night.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>You might guess a long time before
you could tell who at last befriended the
Fairy. It was a Firefly at last who led
her onward by his fairy lantern. He
showed her a pink flower and told her
to jump inside. She did so, spindle, spinning
wheel and all, but the ugly Spider
was almost upon her.</p>

<p>There was nothing left for the Fairy
to do but to stab him with the spindle,
so she did so, and the ugly spider fell
to the ground. Then the pink flower
closed over the Fairy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span></p>

<p>Though the ugly Spider wove a web
over the flower he could not get in. He
said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Now I give to all fair warning</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I will catch the Fairy in the morning.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Time passed, the Fairy did not come
out. The flower lost its petals, still no
Fairy was seen.</p>

<p>The ugly Spider died but the Fairy was
alive and well hidden in the ball the
flower had made. The ball opened soon
and out came a pure, white tassel the
Fairy had been spinning!</p>

<p>We love to think of the industrious
Fairy now when we wear a garment
made of cotton.</p>

<p>The voice of the little Elf sank lower
and lower and soon the little Bunnies
were fast asleep. He sang,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I wonder how much they’ve heard, I said,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">And each one has a story to tell.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>When the Tulips had finished blooming
for one season, the little Elves who
had rocked to and fro in them liked
Mother Bun’s garden so well that they
found other flowers in which to hide.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Ha, ha, ha,” sang Little Elf Laughter,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“Here is the flower I’m looking after.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He settled in a bright, red nasturtium
for a nap.</p>

<p>Next day he was here, and there, and
everywhere.</p>

<p>When Healthy Bunny and Pretty
Bunny were a little cross at breakfast,
he climbed a morning glory vine and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
peeped in the window, and screwed up
his face into a thousand wrinkles.</p>

<p>He looked so sorrowful that the Bunnies
laughed in spite of themselves.</p>

<p>Later, when Old Father Bun looked
quite fierce because he could not find his
pipe, little Elf Laughter sang,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I am Little Elf Laughter, Little Elf Laughter,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I can find what you’re looking after.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>When Old Mother Bun was fretting
about the house cleaning, the Little Elf
called,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Ha, ha, ha, with laugh and song</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I will help the work along.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>When they were all merrily working
in the garden and a sudden shower came
up, he would sing,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Ha, ha, ha, let’s never scold,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Some one may find the pot of gold.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“The pot of gold?” said Old Father
Bun.</p>

<p>“The pot of gold?” inquired Old Mother
Bun.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span></p>

<p>“Where is the pot of gold?” asked
Pretty Bun.</p>

<p>Then, with a merry laugh, Little Elf
Laughter told the story of the pot of
gold at the rainbow end.</p>

<p>The Nasturtium bed was full of bloom;
the pretty flowers nodded to and fro.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“We like to grow in this bed each year,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Pick us as soon as we appear,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">We really need very little attention.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Sure enough, the Nasturtium bed
needed little attention after the seeds
were once planted, and the Humming
Bird came saying,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“To me, the Nasturtium bed is sweet,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I always find here quite a treat.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Geraniums fairly shouted,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Little Elf Laughter, we’re glad you came;</div>

</div>

<p>Little Elf Laughter said, “The seed
pod on this flower does look somewhat
like a stork’s bill, I think.”</p>

<p>Healthy Bunny said, “Are all kinds of
Geraniums the same?”</p>

<p>Pretty Bunny said, “They have different
colors. I know that much.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span></p>

<p>Little Elf Laughter ran to one Geranium
and pressed the leaf between his
tiny fingers. It smelled a little of peppermint.
He said, “This is the Peppermint
Geranium.”</p>

<p>The flowers were white on this plant,
and the leaves were very velvety.</p>

<p>The Rose Geranium sang,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I am very happy, as you suppose;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My leaves when pressed smell like a Rose.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Little Elf Laughter pressed another
Geranium leaf tightly and sang, “The
leaves on this plant smell of penny-royal.”</p>

<p>The Ivy-Leaved Geranium did not want
to remain unnoticed, so it called,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“See my Ivy-leaves, what do you think!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Some of my flowers are red, some pink.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Little Elf Laughter knew the garden
and all the flowers in it well. He pointed
out the horse shoe marks on the leaves
of some of the Geraniums and said,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Here’s a different Geranium, as you see;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It belongs to the Horseshoe variety.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Next, they saw some showy flowers
and Little Elf Laughter said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Our Geranium list is almost done;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Here is Lady Washington.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Just then, a voice called,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Here I am, I’m a late-comer,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Purple Verbena, I bloom all summer.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>There was a great stir in the Poppy
Bed and the Marigolds looked very
splendid beside a tiny white flower called
Love-In-The-Mist.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Little Elf Laughter cried, “Ho, ho,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">See the Pansy faces in a row.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>All the Bunnies loved the Pansies for
the brave little fellows sprang up
early, and bloomed late, and were not
afraid of frost or cold.</p>

<p>While the other Bunnies picked flowers,
Old Father Bun ran to and fro and
finally said,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Here is the spot, we’ll give it a trial;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Here is the place for my new sun-dial.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He was planning to measure time by a
sun-dial. He had a metal plate and dial
plane which was marked off to show directions
of shadows at different hours.</p>

<p>The first sun-dial known was spoken
of in one of the books of the Bible,
Isaiah, and the sun-dial is older than
any clock or watch.</p>

<p>He said a moon-dial was made to
measure night hours by showing the
shadow of the moon or stars.</p>

<p>Patter, patter, patter, fell the drops of
rain.</p>

<p>Old Mother Bun said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Into the house we’ll go again;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My flowers grow in sun and rain.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Into the house they went, and Old
Father Bun said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Flowers, shrubs and trees, as I believe,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Always have roots, stems, and leaves.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Old Mother Bun said,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“You will notice the stem, if you’re wide awake,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And see the direction it will take.</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Straight and upright as can possibly be;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">An ascending stem, slanting from the ground,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">We don’t have to search very far to find</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Another kind of stem that is declined;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A decumbent stem is also found,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">A climbing stem with tendrils, too,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Some day I’ll introduce to you.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Bunnies knew many climbing
stems and shouted, “Grape-Vine, Ivy,
Trumpet-creeper, Pea, Gourd.” They
also talked about round and square
stems.</p>

<p>Old Mother Bun said, “What Flower
Legend shall I tell to-day?” She went
on in verse,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“What Flower Legend shall I tell?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I know and love all flowers well.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Bunnies thought for some time,
but it was Little Elf Laughter who suggested,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Drink Motherwort and you’ll live long,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So goes the Legend and the Song.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Old Mother Bun said, “In far-away
Japan, a stream runs down a hill where
motherwort grows, and the story goes
that people who drink water from that
stream are always young. The Japanese
hold a festival called ‘The Motherwort
Festival,’ and they have a drink made
from this plant.”</p>

<p>By and by the rain was over and the
Bunnies went off to look for the rainbow
end, for they wanted to find the pot
of gold.</p>

<p>Old Father Bun sat comfortably in his
arm-chair and his head went nid-nid
nodding as he said over and over,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Old Mother Bun has happy hours,</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span></p>
<p>Old Mother Bun went out into her
garden.</p>

<p>All the flowers were happy because
of the shower.</p>

<p>Suddenly she heard Little Elf
Laughter singing,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The pot of gold at the rainbow end</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">May be found near home, my friend.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Old Mother Bun looked down at the
end of the garden, and there, sure
enough, she thought she saw the rainbow
end. She began to dig and dig, and
she did strike something bright and
shining. She found a wee pot of gold,
and whether it belonged to the rainbow
end, or the Elves, she did not stop to
ask.</p>

<p>She peeped inside and said, “I will
tell no one yet what I have found; I will
tell no one yet what is inside.”</p>

<p>Healthy Bunny and Pretty Bunny
came home tired.</p>

<p>Old Father Bun said,</p>

<p>He liked to tease Mother Bun about
her flowers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span></p>

<p>Pretty Bunny cried, “Do let me go
and get Homeless Bunny and Happy
Bunny, and Happy-Go-Lucky Bunny and
invite them all to go with us to a picnic.”</p>

<p>Healthy Bunny said, “I will pack our
lunch pail.”</p>

<p>Just then a wee little voice cried,</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">

<p>The Impish Elf came in and jumped
into the butter dish and left the tracks
of his little feet all over the oil cloth.</p>

<p>Old Mother Bun said,</p>

<p>“Can’t I play a trick on the tree-toad

asked the Impish Elf.</p>

<p>Just then Pretty Bunny saw little
white butterflies sailing over the poppies
and sang to the tune of “Twinkle
Little Star,”</p>

<p>Old Father Bun told about some Dryads
that lived in the trees.</p>

<p>“Hark! what is that?” cried Healthy
Bunny.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Click, click, click, like a key,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sounded near them in a tree.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The tree-trunk opened and there
stood a Woodland Fairy. She smiled
and said, “I will tell you a story about
a Nymph who once lived in an oak tree.
She belonged to Ceres, a goddess of long
ago. One day a man ordered the oak,
in which she lived, to be cut down, though
every one begged that it be saved. As
the woodmen would not cut it down, the
lord who owned the place seized the ax
and cut it down himself. Then the
Nymph pronounced this magic upon
him, ‘He can eat and eat but will always
be hungry.’” As she finished her story
the Nymph disappeared in the tree.</p>

<p>The Bunnies tapped on many tree-trunks
to see if another Nymph would
come out. They heard a voice call,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Ha, ha, ha, let me out,</div>

  <img class="w100" src="images/image074.jpg" alt="Dryad" />
</div>

<p>The voice came from another oak tree,
and looking below it, the Bunnies found<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
a key and unlocked a door in the tree
and out came a Dryad with another
story to tell.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="image075" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image075.jpg" alt="Rabbit in stream" />
</div>

<p>She said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“A statue of the Virgin, long ago,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Was placed once in an oak, you know.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A shepherd before it his flute would play;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From a church the statue he’d taken away.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He was sentenced to prison for theft, you see,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the statue taken out of the tree.</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">That night the statue walked out, they say,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And let the imprisoned shepherd away.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I hope you’ll remember this tale of mine,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Because the image became a shrine.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Back into the tree went the Dryad and
the Bunnies said, “What wonderful
stories we learn in the woods to-day.”</p>

<p>Just then a call “Help, help,” was
heard.</p>

<p>Happy-Go-Lucky had fallen into the
stream and Homeless Bunny was trying
to get him out.</p>

<p>They all ran as fast as they could and
by and by rescued him; then Old Father
Bun built a fire so they could all warm
their paws and whiskers.</p>

<p>Picking up a branch from the Linden
tree Old Mother Bun said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The blade, foot-stalk and stipules see,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The parts of the leaf upon the tree.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Bunnies drew near her to see the
branch she was looking at.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span></p>

<p>Old Father Bun said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Here is something that I’ve found.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Leaves are simple, or compound,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Simple, when in one piece, ’tis said,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Compound, when more pieces in the blade.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Bunnies gathered leaves about
them. They saw that some were Parallel-veined
and some were Feather-veined.
Some of the veins in the leaves ran side
by side, and some of them branched out.
They saw some wild grape vine leaves
that were still different; they had three
main ribs and veins extending out from
them. They were called Radiate-veined.</p>

<p>Old Mother Bun said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“We would be here ’till set of sun,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If we studied leaf-shapes every one.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Old Father Bun’s eyes twinkled and
he said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Leaves have different margins too;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Some of them I’ll introduce to you.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then the first surprising thing happened!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span></p>

<p>The wind blew a great blast and down
fell many leaves. They made a gay
carpet.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The little Bunnies cried, “What fun!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It is almost as though autumn had come.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then the second surprising thing
happened! For they were in a fairy woodland.
Every leaf began to talk, and
by placing it to the ear each Bunny
could hear what it wanted to say.</p>

<p>One leaf said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“My shape is Linear, longer than wide;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I could tell you other things beside.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Another voice cried,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I am Lance-shaped, to a point I taper;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The wind plays with me many a caper.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Another voice cried,</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I am not nearly as broad as long;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Tell it in verse, I am called oblong.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Oval leaf spoke, and the Ovate-leaf,
the Heart-shaped leaf, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
Kidney-shaped leaf, the Arrow-shaped
leaf and the Ear-shaped leaf, and then
the third surprising thing happened!</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Just then the fourth surprising
thing happened!</p>

<p>A great wind came up and blew Homeless
Bunny over hill and dale. It blew
Happy-Go-Lucky Bunny over hill and

Shadow Bunny to the end of Nowhere.

<p>Into the garden trooped the Flower

<p>All the visitors did not arrive on

<p>The Butterflies came in handsome

new mirror.</p>

<p>The Birds came bringing her a new

<p>The Flower Families crowded around
the Peddler and each bought a present
for Old Mother Bun.</p>

<p>The Peddler had many interesting
stories to tell, and the Pretty Elf told
stories, and the Marigold Family told
stories, too. The Pool-Flower had a
word to say; the Water-Dragon and
Mary Bud said, “Let us relate our own
story, please.” They were all members
of the Marigold Family.</p>

<p>One of the members of the Marigold
Family said, “Once Caltha fell in love
with the Sun-god and looked up at him
day after day. All night she waited for
the first rosy hint of the sun’s coming.
She became a spirit reflecting the sun,
and she turned into a Marigold.”</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>They gathered leaves and went inside
and warmed their paws by the fire.</p>

<p>The little Bunnies noticed that the
leaves did not all look alike. They were
different in size, form and color.</p>

<p>The Pretty Elf sang,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Bunnies did as they were told,

fairy.</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Each little fairy from the leaf danced
to Old Mother Bun and left a present.</p>

<p>Just as the Bunnies were wondering
if it were bed time, a “rap-a-tap” was
heard and in came the Peddler singing,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p>Old Mother Bun gave the Peddler a
fine supper and asked him to stay for
the night. He said, after supper,</p>

</div>

<p>Pretty Bunny and Healthy Bunny
thought it great fun to peep into the
Peddler’s pack, and by and by they
drew out a wonderful book all about
Flowers.</p>

<p>It had one chapter called, “Uses of
Plants.”</p>

<p>The Bunnies read aloud,</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>They invited the Peddler to stay with
them and he almost consented. He said
at any rate he would give them the book
about Flowers.</p>

<p>When the Bunnies were falling asleep,
they heard a gentle “pitter, patter.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span></p>

<p>Said Old Mother Bun, “What can be the matter?”</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Next morning the little Bunnies looked
under their pillows and each found a little
booklet. One was shaped like a daisy
and one like a buttercup. On each was
written an invitation to a Flower Show.
The invitation read,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>One fall day Old Mother Bun said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Off and away we soon will go</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To the City Flower Show.”</div>

</div>
</div>

<p>Old Father Bun said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Wait until my Scarecrow is made;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The crows are in the corn, I’m afraid.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He went out to make a Scarecrow.</p>

<p>Old Mother Bun called anxiously,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“You’ll bring on yourself some disaster,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If you step on my bed of asters!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Old Father Bun put up two sticks in
the garden and nailed a board across.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
He put a hat and suit of clothes on his
Scarecrow. The Scarecrow looked very
life-like when he was finished.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">One Bunny thought he could hear him walk;</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Some day I may take you by surprise.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>At this very instant Old Mother Bun
called,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Father Bun, did you hear what I said?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Don’t tumble into my Aster bed.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>She was so afraid Father Bun would
not notice where he was going and disturb
some of her flowers.</p>

<p>Old Mother Bun loved her fall flowers,
so she called again,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Of my Petunias have a care;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Father Bun, don’t step there.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Healthy Bunny and Pretty Bunny
went out and gathered Golden-rod and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
brought it home, and set it in great jars
by the front door. The Golden-rod said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“By the road I grow, but this I know,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I sing it over, hour by hour,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I sing it over hour by hour</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I am your chosen National Flower.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Even as the Golden-rod talked, the
song-finch and song sparrow came to see
if there were any seeds ready for them.</p>

<p>Happy-Go-Lucky Bunny came in sight
with a surprise for Old Mother Bun. He
had a basket full of the little plant she
wanted for her wild flower garden called,
“Butter-And-Eggs.”</p>

<p>These little plants trembled all over
when they were transplanted into
Mother Bun’s garden.</p>

<p>The Butter-And-Eggs said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“We are curious as you know,</div>

<p>Happy Bunny came hoppety-skip
along shouting,</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">“Who will go, who will go</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>They could not see Echo Bunny but a
voice called, “Flower Show.”</p>

<p>Homeless Bunny and Shadow Bunny
came with their baskets and cried,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The time is creeping on, you know;</div>

  </div>

    <div class="verse indent0">The Stay-At-Home Bunny said, “I beg pardon,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But I will weed a while in Mother Bun’s garden.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Bunnies all took rakes and hoes
and began to weed the garden. They
sang to the tune of “Lightly Row,” as
they worked.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Rake and hoe, rake and hoe,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Help the flowers grow.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Soon everything seemed ready and
they started off to the Flower Show,
when Old Mother Bun turned her ankle
and feared she could not walk another
step, so they set up a wail,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Another step she cannot go,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Alas! alas! for the Flower Show.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span></p>
<p>Old Father Bun got a wheelbarrow
and they took turns wheeling her.</p>

<p>When they came to the Flower Show
they saw rooms and rooms filled with
Cactus and many curious flowers.</p>

<p>The Pitcher Plant had each little
pitcher partly filled with water. It said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I tell you I like boggy ground;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I am glad you came around;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Insects get in and laugh and shout,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But I seldom let them out.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Pretty Bunny peeped into the Pitcher
Plant and saw something sticky on the
inside and hairs pointing downward
which made it hard to get out.</p>

<p>Old Mother Bun was much interested
in the Cactus, and reaching out its
thorns, it cried,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“In the desert go look for me;</div>

</div>
</div>

</div>


<p>All the flowers were beautiful and
each one had a story to tell.</p>

<p>Old Father Bun bought a great basket
of chrysanthemums to take home. One
very large flower said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Old Father Bun, do you hear me sigh?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There are no Chrysanthemums in Himaji.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This flower said that Chrysanthemums
grew all over China except in this one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
place, because it was not thought lucky
to raise them there.</p>

<p>The story goes that a great man once
had a servant who took care of his gold
plates, and one day one gold plate was
missing. The servant was so afraid that
she threw herself in a well, and her
ghost comes every night at the stroke
of nine to count the gold plates.</p>

<p>All about the Flower Show were
quaint figures, some of them made entirely
of Chrysanthemums.</p>

<p>On their way home the Bunnies met
Mistress Mary and she was so contrary
she would not tell how her flowers were
growing. She only said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The rose is red, the violet blue,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The Gillyflower sweet&mdash;and so are you.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>She looked at Old Mother Bun, for
everyone loved her.</p>

<p>The Bunnies were so tired Old Mother
Bun began to tell them a story, as some
of them rode in the wheelbarrow and
some of them trudged along.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span></p>
<p>She continued: “Every night he went
to Sleepy Town and one night he saw
Father Bun so sleepy that he said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“On the Rocking Horse you can go,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Trot, trot, trot to Dreamland, you know.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Soon they met Shy Squirrel and
Sleepy Sparrow and they all flew on the
back of the Rocking Horse.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">All night long, all night long,</div>

<p>At this very minute in the telling of
the story there appeared a ROCKING

on his back and left the old wheelbarrow
in the road.</p>

<p>Soon they all arrived and the Rocking
Horse rocked all about the garden
and though they begged him to stay for
the night he went off singing,</p>

<p>Next day Old Father Bun was so busy

    <div class="verse indent0">The window-box cried: “Your next trip,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Come and place in me another slip;”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The Bulbs said to the Bunnies, son and daughter:</div>

</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span></p>
<p>They planted some Bulbs in water and
watched the long white roots grow downward
day after day, while the green
stalks shot upward.</p>

<p>That night Old Mother Bun was sitting
up late when she heard a voice call,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Old Mother Bun, Old Mother Bun,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Look at your Scarecrow, just for fun.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>She looked out and saw the Scarecrow
dancing to and fro and a Wee Elf peeping
out of each pocket.</p>

<p>She put on a shawl and went into the
garden.</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">Old Mother Bun went to her Pansy bed,</div>

<p>Old Mother Bun picked a basket full
of Pansies to send to a sick neighbor
the next day.</p>

<p>The Pansies must have heard what
Old Mother Bun and Echo Bunny said,
for next day the bed was full of bloom.</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>One afternoon Old Mother Bun had
worked so hard in her garden that she
fell asleep, and she thought instead of
autumn it was springtime, and that she
heard all her Flowering Trees talking
together.</p>

<p>The Redbud Tree said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“My flowers are pretty, every one believes,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And I put out my pink flowers before my leaves.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Silver Bell Tree laughed and its
laughter sounded like a bell going
“tinkle, tinkle, tinkle.”</p>

<p>The Catalpa Tree sang,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">

    <div class="verse indent0">Down they fall, my big white flowers.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Witch Hazel Tree said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I love to bloom in this garden of yours;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">See my flower-parts, in fours.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Hawthorn Tree said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Spring time’s a happy time, every one believes;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I put my flowers out, after my green leaves.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>A voice sang,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Ha, ha, ha, now we see</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Flowers on the Nutmeg Tree.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Nutmeg Flowers grow on an
evergreen tree.</p>

<p>The voice continued,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“If spices are among your needs,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Soon we’ll be growing safe and sound,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And bear fruit all the year around.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Old Mother Bun was wakened from
her dream by hearing a voice call,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Wake up, wake up, at any cost,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We must haste before Jack Frost.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Old Father Bun had many flower-pots
in a row, and the little Bunnies were
helping him pot Geraniums.</p>

<p>He said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Dig up the roots with much dirt around;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They will hardly know they have left the ground.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Old Mother Bun said, “I had such a
wonderful dream! I thought it was
springtime.”</p>

<p>That evening as they sat by the fire,
they heard some one call,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Rap-a-tap, rap-a-tap,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Let me in, it’s no time to nap.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>They opened the door and the cutest
little fellow stood, hat in hand, saying,</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">But I’m called the Green House Bunny.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He told Old Father Bun there were
plenty of bricks in the back yard to start
in building the Green House, and there
were some old window-lights that would
do for the hot beds.</p>

<p>Next day they all set to work in real
earnest and began to build.</p>

<p>Old Mother Bun began to think of
selling her flowers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span></p>

<p>She wrote cute little cards saying,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

    <div class="verse indent0">“Come and see what I have new;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Chrysanthemums I introduce to you.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Many of the potted plants fairly
trembled in their pots as they thought of
having a nice warm place to spend the
winter in and a real Green House.</p>

<p>The little Bunnies were planning one
corner for their bulbs. They were planning
to plant slips in a bed of sand.</p>

<p>The Green House Bunny sang to the
tune of “Yankee Doodle,”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“If you will plant a slip each day,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">We’ll soon have something new, Sir!”</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span></p>
<p>The Green House Bunny remarked,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Before I go on my vacation,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I want to talk about propagation.”</div>

</div>
</div>

<p>Old Mother Bun said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Green House Bunny, before you go,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Will you tell us how plants grow?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Green House Bunny answered,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I like plants better far than weeds;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They multiply by buds and seeds.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He took the Bunnies out into the
garden and bent a branch down to the
ground. He cut a notch in it, and covered
it with earth. He said it would root
by and by and could be cut off then from
the main branch.</p>

<p>He said we could also make plants
grow from slips, seeds, and bulbs.</p>

<p>As they went back into the Green-house,
the Green House Bunny showed
them a picture of a water-lily, saying,
“A Water-Nymph hides in the shape of
a water-lily, and becomes a beautiful
maiden when she chooses and,</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">Lives under the leaves from morn till night.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The little water-sprite tries to play
tricks on any one who gathers the Water-lilies.”</p>

<p>So saying,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The Green House Bunny went hippety-hop,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Off and away to his own little shop.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Old Mother Bun said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“We Bunnies will have capital fun,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For now our Green House is nearly done.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Old Father Bun said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Off and away to the woods I’ll go;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I’ll bring back treasures, as you know.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Healthy Bunny and Pretty Bunny
went with him, and my! what treasures
they did find to bring back!</p>

<p>They brought gay autumn leaves, and
milk-weed pods, and wild grapes, and
nuts, and they sang,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">

    <div class="verse indent0">See the bonfire’s purple haze.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>All went merrily with the Bunnies until
Pretty Bunny grew ill. She was
sleepy all the time and nothing seemed
to interest her.</p>

<p>The sunshine said, “I will wake her.”</p>

<p>The raindrops said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I’ll tinkle, tinkle on the window pane;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I will make Pretty Bunny laugh again.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Pretty Bunny did not laugh at the
raindrops.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">What next happened do you suppose?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There crept on a vine a little late rose.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It crept up, up, up, and peeped in at
Pretty Bunny and inside the rose was
curled up Little Tickle Toes, the merry
Elf.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">He tickled her toes and tickled her nose,</div>

</div>

<p>Soon Pretty Bunny was well and
helped Old Mother Bun protect her
roses, and cover the fern bed and soon
snow fell on Old Mother Bun’s garden,
but the flowers in the Green House were
blooming merrily, and many customers
came to buy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span></p>

    <div class="verse indent0">How many times a day I cannot tell.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Nearly every house in Bunnyville had
a blooming plant in the window.</p>

<p>Old Father Bun went off every evening
into his little work-shop. He kept
up a great singing and humming and all
the Bunnies wondered what he was doing.
He said to himself,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I have been working hours and hours</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To try to make some paper flowers.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He took a Tulip petal, and traced
around it on card board and used this as
a pattern. He cut many petals from red
crepe paper for his Tulips. He placed
wire between two paper petals and
glued them together, then he wired all
the petals together and put a little yellow
round on the end of his stem, which
he wrapped with green paper.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="image116" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image116.jpg" alt="Paper tulips etc." />
</div>

<p>While he was doing this, Old Mother
Bun had some fun of her own. She cut<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
out some birds and butterflies of paste-board
and painted them gayly. She
fastened them on twigs and set them
around in the flower pots.</p>

<p>When Old Father Bun came out with
his paper Tulips everything looked very
gay.</p>

<p>Late that night, when the rest of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
Bunnies were sleeping, Old Mother Bun
looked out into her garden covered with
snow. She sighed for her flowers but
a fairy voice called,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Don’t let me ever find you weeping,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For your flowers are only sleeping,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Safe in Mother Nature’s keeping.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Moon peeped out from a cloud and
said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“On your garden I am streaming,</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>A little star twinkled and hummed,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I twinkle, twinkle in the blue,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And a watch I keep for you,</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Sun-dial showed the days were
getting shorter and shorter.</p>

<p>It said,</p>

<p>Pretty Bunny and Healthy Bunny
dreamed that night that they were sailing
away, away, in milk-weed cradles.</p>

<p>The winter had been hard and long.</p>

<p>Old Mother Bun had patched and
mended the Bunnies’ clothes, and Old
Father Bun had mended and patched the
furniture, and, except for visitors to the
Green House, they had seen little of the
outside world.</p>

<p>One morning the Pansies lifted their
heads and the Crocuses began to grow.
Said old Mother Bun, “I sing and sing,
For all these flowers are signs of spring.”</p>

<p>Old Father Bun heard the Birds singing
and he said,</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">“Hear that noisy clitter-clatter,</div>

<p>The March Hare came bounding in the
window.</p>

<p>He upset the cups and saucers and
spilled the cream from the pitcher.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<p>He was so noisy it was some time before
Old Father Bun’s voice could be
heard. He said by and by,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p>The March Hare turned two somersaults

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I may be here, I may be away,</div>

<p>“Hurrah, hurrah,” cried Pretty Bunny.</p>

<p>“Hurrah, hurrah,” cried Happy-Go-Lucky
Bunny.</p>

<p>Shadow Bunny said, “I hope you will
give the Play on a sunny day, so I can
be there.”</p>

<p>The Friendly Tree Toad chirped,</p>

</div>

<p>The Bunnies sat down in a circle and
put on their thinking caps, for they had
no dimes or pennies with which to buy
costumes for the Flower Play.</p>

<p>Suddenly, without any warning whatever,
Old Father Bun began to laugh
and Old Mother Bun began to laugh, and
Healthy Bunny said,</p>

<p>Old Mother Bun got the pot of gold
she had found at the rainbow end, and
took off the cover. Out rolled more gold
pieces than you have ever dreamed of!</p>

<p>She had forgotten all about the pot of
gold.</p>

<p>Now, they could buy costumes for the
Flower Play.</p>

<p>They began to think about the Play.</p>

<p>The March Hare said he would be the
Clown, and the Tree Toad said he would
be ticket-seller.</p>

<p>They built a real little stage in Old
Mother Bun’s Garden, and they studied
their parts until one bright May day
when the sun shone warm and bright,
the March Hare gave the prologue and
the Play began on the day set for it:</p>

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a

by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
